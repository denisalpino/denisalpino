I'm a 4th year student at GSOM SPbU, specializing in Information Management. I have long been interested in programming, business and math, and especially in the intersection of these 3 spheres, which for me has become machine learning. Now I'm studying hard to get into Master's and PhD programs, as well as get a job as an AI Researcher.
